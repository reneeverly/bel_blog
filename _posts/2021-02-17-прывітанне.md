Hello and welcome to my Belarusian Language Study blog!  I look forward to collecting and curating a set of resources and helpful tips for people interested in learning the Belarusian language.

I will be attempting to gear this blog and its resources from the perspective of an English speaker looking to learn Belarusian.  Although having an understanding of another slavic family language such as Ukrainian would be beneficial to a prospective learner, it isn't a requirement.

At the moment, I have posted a few links in the "resoruces & links" page listed in the navbar.
